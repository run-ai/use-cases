# Use-cases

This is a collection of various client-requested use-cases. Each use-case is accompanied by a short live-demo video, along with all the files used. As we learn more about our clients' specific needs, this page will be updated with new content. 
  
+ [mlflow with Run:ai](./runai_mlflow_demo): experiment management is important for Data Scientist. This is a demo of how to set up and use mlflow with Run:ai  
+ [Docker intro](./runai_docker_intro): Run:ai runs using Docker images. This is a (very) brief introduction to Docker, image creation, and how to use them in the context of Run:ai.
